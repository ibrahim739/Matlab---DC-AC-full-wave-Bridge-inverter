# Matlab---DC-AC-full-wave-Bridge-inverter
Two models of a DC-AC inverter - The full wave Bridge Inverter.
Model 1 is the basic one.
Model2 is the ideal one.
Ac ac output is synthesized from a dc input by closing and opening the switches in an appropriate sequence. The output voltage Vo can be +Vdc, -Vdc or zero, depending on which switches are closed.
Result scopes are just for Model 1, althoug the result are identical, obviously.
